Upon clicking the "pause" button, rutorrent will stop refreshing automatically.  You can manually refresh the ui by clicking the "refresh button" _This is the button to the right of the pause button in the picture above_

After clicking the "pause" button, it will change to a "play" button as shown here:

According to the plugins author, this plugin will also stop rutorrent from refreshing automatically when the tab isn't in use via the web browser, saving bandwidth, cpu cylces and memory.
