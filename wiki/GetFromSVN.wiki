=How to download ruTorrent via SVN=
----

<wiki:toc />

== Description ==

You must have [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] installed. Consult your unix distribution page for details.
 
If you wish to install rutorrent to /var/www/rutorrent, execute the following commands:
{{{
cd /var/www/
svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rutorrent
}}}

== Updating or checking out a different revision ==

If you've already checked out ruTorrent from svn, and which to update it to the current revision, cd to the directory ruTorrent is installed and run a "svn update" like in the following example.
_(note: in this example rutorrent has been installed to /var/www/rutorrent. Your webroot may be different)_

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent
svn up
}}}

If you wish to check out a specific revision, add -r revision_number.  For example, to check out revision 870 you would do something like this:
_(note: this is rarely necessary, but in rare occasions, a new revision will break compatibility.  In these situations, knowing how to check out an earlier revision can be golden)._

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent
svn up -r 870
}}}


_*(note:  It's very important to remember, when upgrading from one revision to another, you should always stop rtorrent before you upgrade, upgrade, then restart rtorrent.  Failure to stop/start rtorrent when upgrading can lead to plugins not working properly)*_

== Checking out Plugins ==

Checking out plugins is basically the same as checking out the base system. If you already have rutorrent installed, simply change to the *plugins/* directory under rutorrent, and check out your plugin, like in the following example. For example, if you have rutorrent installed to /var/www/rutorrent and would like to check out the rpc plugin:

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins
svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/rpc
}}}

_(note: for a full list of available plugins please see [Plugins] page)_.

== Updating Plugins ==

Updating plugins works exactly like updating rutorrent:

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rpc
svn up
}}}

but you can also update all the plugins by doing something like this:
{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins
svn up *
}}}


=== Wonslung's Method ===

_*(NOTE: If you read this and do not understand it, please stick to the section ABOVE this point)*_


I tend to prefer downloading everything from trunk, and using plugins.ini to disable the plugins i do not plan to use.  _(See [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/Plugins#plugins.ini plugins.ini] for more details)*_

This works something like this:

{{{
cd /var/www
svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
rm -rf trunk/rutorrent/plugins/
mv trunk/plugins/ trunk/rutorrent/
mv trunk/rutorrent/ /var/www/
rm -rf /var/www/trunk/
}}}

This will give you rutorrent installed to /var/www/rutorrent with all plugins.  If you wish to update the svn, you simply do the following:

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/
svn up
}}}

and it will update rutorrent core and all of the plugins which come from the rutorrent svn _*but not any 3rd party plugins.  Refer to any documentation from the 3rd party vendor for these plugins. *_

Like i said above, i simply disable any plugins i do not plan to use by editing the plugins.ini file.  You can do this on a per user basis as well.
