== Description ==

This plugin allows you to switch users or logoff on systems which use authentication.


=== Installation ===

You can install via tarball or svn.  

Assuming rutorrent is installed at /var/www/rutorrent/, to install via tarball do the following:

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/
wget http://rutorrent-logoff.googlecode.com/files/logoff-1.0.tar.gz
tar -zxf logoff-1.0.tar.gz
}}}

Assuming the same install path, to install via svn do the following:

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/
svn checkout http://rutorrent-logoff.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ logoff
}}}

*Important:  Currently this plugin _WILL NOT WORK_ if the directory isn't named "logoff", this may change in the future*



=== Usage ===

This plugin adds the following icon to the top bar:

If you wish to change user, enter the users name/password in the proper locations and click "Switch User", otherwise click "Log Off" to Log off or "Cancel" to get back to rutorrent as the current user.


*Note: Currently, if you enter bad information, such as the wrong username or password, you will need to kill the page and reload, otherwise you end up in an infinite loop.*
