== Description ==

This plugin adds a new category to the "peers" tab which displays the host lookup for each client.

== Installation ==

download the file from http://www.rozhuk.org.ru/download/software/rTorrent/hostname_31.zip

extract it, and place in the rutorrent/plugins/ directory

*Note:* _This file isn't a standard zip file, it's a 7-zip file (LZMA) You will need the proper 7-zip extraction software to extract it.  On FreeBSD i installed p7zip (this should work on ubuntu as well_

Assuming rutorrent is installed to /var/www/rutorrent, and you have install p7zip, issue the following commands:

{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/
wget http://www.rozhuk.org.ru/download/software/rTorrent/hostname_31.zip
7z x hostname_31.zip
rm hostname_31.zip
}}}
