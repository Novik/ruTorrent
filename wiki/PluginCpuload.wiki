== How it Works ==

The plugin is purely for cosmetic use.  It's pretty generalized in it's current state, and should not be taken as 100% accurate.  


The formula for cpuload, currently is

*`min(load_average[0]*100/processors_count,100)`*

where `load_average[0]` - count of processes in run queue in the last
minute.

processors_count is always 1 for non-Linux systems.
