== Description ==

This plugin adds a chatbox to multi-user rutorrent installs.  *_NOTE:  Currently this is a single server chat program only (if you have multiple servers, this will NOT allow your users to chat across them)_*



=== Installation and usage ===

The 3rd party wiki has all of this information, i see no point in trying to maintain it in 2 locations.
